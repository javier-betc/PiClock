"""
This example shows connecting to the PN532 with I2C (requires clock
stretching support), SPI, or UART. SPI is best, it uses the most pins but
is the most reliable and universally supported.
After initialization, try waving various 13.56MHz RFID cards over it!

This example is production ready and has been working for a year now. We use an excel file that lists the date swiped and name of employee
